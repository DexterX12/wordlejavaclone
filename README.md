## A WORDLE JAVA CLONE

This is a **Wordle** clone made in **Java** for a college project. It requires no extra libs whatsoever. It has no GUI, so it only works on command line.

Its features are:

- **Paints the letters depending on the status of the word the user entered.**
- **It works for any word with any amount of letters**
- **It reads words from a plain txt file, so you can add/remove words as you please.**
